# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This repository contains several tasks demonstrating the implementation ... (to finish later)

### Files

Each task is implemented in its own C file, focusing on a specific operation on a `listint_s` structure.

- `0-bubble_sort.c` :
  Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.
- `1-insertion_sort_list.c` :
  Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm.
- `2-selection_sort.c` :
  Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
- `3-quick_sort.c` :
  Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm.
- `0-O , 1-O , 2-O , 3-O` :
  The big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm for each task.
